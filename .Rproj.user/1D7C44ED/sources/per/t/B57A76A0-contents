Title: Testing measures of predictor importance in species distribution models

Description: This package is designed to assess how well commonly-
    used measures of variable importance in ecological niche models
    (ENMs) or species distribution models (SDMs) actually work. Its
    core functions generate simulated landscapes and species,
    iterate training of SDMs using this data, and calculate
    variable importance, which can be compared to an "omniscient"
    test which is always correct. It is provided as companion code
    to Smith & Santos YYYY PAPER TITLE JOURNAL VOL:PAGES.
